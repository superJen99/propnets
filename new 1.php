Use config to determine what functions are to be programmed and linked amidst classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

diff (a, b): find the distance value as difference between two given props a->b
pos (dir, angle): direction and angle of pos, position
var (pos, prop): variation type (i.e. prop type) of prop @ pos
serialise (0, 1 (prop, var)): store current prop_var 
	e.g. whether to stack current prop solutions/layers (var), else autoabstract current limit
dropout (): i.e. pi applied to limit of prop potential focused on x	(i.e. when to rest after exhausting motivation limit from potential)
	can be used to find the most optimal state for activation function (e.g. when to terminate @ semantic point with current sequence of input being read)
abstract (0->1): applied to some prop p, this determines how abstract or literal some output of this will be
context (0->1): depth of context from which to output some prop p response 
sequence (depth, limit (default | dropout)): find a sequence of some prop p to the length of limit
entropy => delta

---------------------------------
^denotes emergent or special properties (as properties either themselves or functions (e.g. ^f(p)))
e.g. SV, it can only be manifested and not declared and must acquire self-reinforcement (SR) via a learning-abstract to maintain
itself (SR->LA) until it eventually manifests maintenance of these and thereron as a stable force for geometric evolution being sequenced 
(GSA as a byproduct? i.e. if f(GSA(0,1)) assumes 0 as its position to-from/start-end/etc and 1 as its contextual limit, then can a byproduct
be skipped? (i.e. bypassed as jumping from epochs of GSA evolutionary steps))
